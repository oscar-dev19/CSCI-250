Based on how Google works I believe having code standards works in a business
thats an engineering company. Keeping a consistent codebase thats formatted the
same across all engineering teams helps prevent unnecessary formatting and 
debugging headaches. For example the most common 'meme' in computer science has 
to be the whole 'spaces vs tabs' conversations. Setting some guidelines and 
standards allows this to be disregarded and also prevent a codebase from 
functioning in one computer but not on another (syntax errors). Google mentions
in the beginning of the documentation that it is recommended to use some 
standard tool such as pylint to format code. Of course google also makes regards
to some issues that can come across but does mention exceptions and ways to 
go around it. 

Of course having consistent formatting across all codebases also means more 
consistent documentaion. With several teams needing to borrow eachother's 
code or reviewing eachothers code it is beneficial to be familiar with the way
code is documented and can make it easier for other teams to know what eachother's
code is doing and what is expected. Google mentions on how to document classes,
how to document licensing rights on the code, using docstrings, how to write 
block and inline comments etc in their style guidelines. It even makes notes on
making sure punctuation and spelling are to be correct and maintain proper 
grammar when documenting your code.

I also believe that having rules on what is to be returned or how particular 
cases should be dealt with help automate code. Google has a lot of code 
being shipped and reviewed constantly and having a set of rules of how the code
should act allows the q/a teams to understand how to write their tests and be 
familiar with how the code may act. 

To conclude, I initially felt as though these guidelines are constrictive or 
tedious. However after reading the guidelines and understanding in some way 
how an engineering company as google works having a guideline makes sense. 
I feel that every company or team should have something similar if not the 
same. It can facilitate a lot of things and help keep the business consistent
with their code base and clients.
