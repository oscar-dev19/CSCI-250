Skill 3: Comparing big-o, big-omega, and big-theta analysis
Date: Sep 25, 2019

In general, Big O talks about the upper bounds of a running function. Meaning
that 'big o' is really talking about the relationship of a function as its 
input is reaching some value whether it is finite or an infinite value. 
Mathematically this is similar as limits in calculus. In other words 'big o'
is considering the worst-case scenario of a function.

On the otherhand, big-theta talks about the upper and lower bounds of a function.
Big theta is not concerned with the best case scenario or worst case scenario. 
In general it is only concerned with how the function generally acts regardless
of the inputs (parameters) of the function. In Mathematics this means big theta 
is looking at whether the function is quadratic, linear, etc.

Big-omega is similar to big-o but differs that big-omega is concerned with only 
the lower bounds of a function (or the best-case scenario). Big-omega looks at 
the best amount of time a function can run at.
